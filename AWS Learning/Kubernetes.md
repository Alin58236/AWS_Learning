Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes allows you to run containerized applications across a cluster of nodes, providing features for high availability, scalability, and resilience.

#### **Key Concepts:**

- **Containers:** Kubernetes runs applications in containers, which are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments for running software.
- **Pods:** Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share networking and storage resources.
- **Nodes:** Nodes are the individual machines (physical or virtual) in a Kubernetes cluster where containers are deployed. Each node runs a Kubernetes runtime environment, such as Docker or "containerd".
- **Clusters:** A Kubernetes cluster consists of multiple nodes that work together to run containerized applications. It includes a control plane for managing the cluster and worker nodes for running application workloads.
- **Deployments:** Deployments are Kubernetes objects used to manage the lifecycle of applications. They define the desired state of the application, including the number of replicas, and ensure that the application stays running as specified.
- **Services:** Kubernetes Services expose applications running in pods to other parts of the cluster or external clients. They provide networking and load balancing capabilities to route traffic to pods based on labels and selectors.

#### **Kubernetes Architecture:**

- **Control Plane:** The control plane consists of several components that manage the Kubernetes cluster's overall state and orchestrate workloads. Key components include the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd (a distributed key-value store for storing cluster state).
- **Nodes:** Nodes are the worker machines in the Kubernetes cluster where containers are deployed and run. Each node runs a kubelet (agent for managing containers), container runtime (such as Docker), and other optional components like kube-proxy (for network proxying) and container network interface (CNI) plugins.

#### **Deploying Applications:**

- **Creating Deployments:** Use Kubernetes YAML manifests to define Deployments, specifying container images, ports, replicas, and other configuration settings.
- **Scaling Applications:** Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling of applications by adjusting the number of replicas in a Deployment to handle changes in load or demand.
- **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes Services provide a stable endpoint for accessing applications running in pods. Services can be exposed internally within the cluster or externally to clients outside the cluster.
- **Configuring Networking:** Kubernetes networking allows pods to communicate with each other within the cluster. Network policies can be applied to control traffic between pods based on rules and labels.


#### **Monitoring and Logging:**

- **Metrics:** Kubernetes provides built-in monitoring capabilities through metrics collected from cluster components and workloads. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are commonly used for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.
- **Logging:** Kubernetes clusters generate logs from various components and workloads, which can be collected and aggregated using logging solutions like Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (ELK stack).

#### **Security:**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Kubernetes RBAC allows you to define granular access controls and permissions for users and service accounts within the cluster.
- **Pod Security Policies:** Pod Security Policies enforce security policies at the pod level, controlling aspects such as privilege escalation, container capabilities, and volume mounts.
- **Network Policies:** Kubernetes Network Policies allow you to define rules for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to pods based on labels and selectors.


#### **Advanced Topics:**

- **Stateful Applications:** Kubernetes supports running stateful applications such as databases using StatefulSets, which provide stable, unique identities for pods and support ordered deployment and scaling.
- **Operators:** Kubernetes Operators are custom controllers that extend Kubernetes functionality to manage complex, stateful applications automatically.
- **Multi-Cluster Management:** Kubernetes Federation allows you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single entity, enabling centralized control and resource management across distributed environments.
