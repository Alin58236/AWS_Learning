Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are two cryptographic protocols used to provide secure communication over the internet. SSL was developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s and TLS is its successor. These protocols are used to secure web traffic, email, instant messaging, and other types of internet traffic. SSL and TLS use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to encrypt data, ensuring that information transmitted over the internet is secure and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.

- TLS is just a newer and more secure version of SSL. 
- Used for privacy and Data Integrity between client & server.
- Privacy - communications are encrypted
- Asymmetric and the symmetric
- Identity verified (server or client/server)
- Reliable connection - protect against alteration
