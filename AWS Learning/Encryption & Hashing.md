Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (human-readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using cryptographic algorithms and keys. The purpose of encryption is to protect data confidentiality, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access or understand the encrypted information without the corresponding decryption key.

#### Components of Encryption

- **Plaintext:** The original human-readable data that needs to be protected.
- **Ciphertext:** The encrypted data produced by applying encryption algorithms to the plaintext.
- **Encryption Algorithm:** A mathematical function or algorithm used to perform the encryption process.
- **Key:** A secret parameter used by the encryption algorithm to control the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext.
- **Decryption Algorithm:** The inverse process of encryption, used to convert ciphertext back into plaintext using the decryption key.

### Types of Encryption

- **Symmetric Encryption:** In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Examples include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

##### **Example of Symmetric Encryption in Python using AES:**

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES 
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes 
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import scrypt 

# Generate a random key 
password = b'mysecretpassword' 
salt = get_random_bytes(16) 
key = scrypt(password, salt, 32, N=2**14, r=8, p=1) 

# Encryption 
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM) 
plaintext = b'Hello, world!' 
cipher_text, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext) 

# Decryption 
cipher_decrypt = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=cipher.nonce) 
decrypted_text = cipher_decrypt.decrypt_and_verify(cipher_text, tag) 

print("Plaintext:", plaintext) 
print("Ciphertext:", cipher_text) 
print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text)
```

##### **Example of Asymmetric Encryption in Python using RSA:**

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA 
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP 

# Generate key pair 
key = RSA.generate(2048) 

# Encryption 
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key.publickey()) 
plaintext = b'Hello, world!' 
ciphertext = cipher_rsa.encrypt(plaintext) 

# Decryption 
cipher_decrypt = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key) 
decrypted_text = cipher_decrypt.decrypt(ciphertext) 

print("Plaintext:", plaintext) 
print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext) 
print("Decrypted text:", decrypted_text)
```



### Steganography

Sometimes encryption is not as efficient as we would expect mainly because if we see a ciphertext we don't know what it means, but we surely see that it is a ciphertext..
Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within non-secret data or media in such a way that the existence of the hidden information is not drawing any attention. Unlike encryption, which focuses on making the contents of a message unreadable to unauthorized parties, steganography aims to hide the presence of the message itself. Steganography techniques can be applied to various types of media, including images, audio files, video files, and text documents.

##### **Types of Steganography:**

- **Image Steganography:** Embedding secret messages or data within digital images.
- **Audio Steganography:** Concealing messages within audio files, such as MP3 or WAV files.
- **Video Steganography:** Hiding data within video files, often imperceptible to human senses.
- **Text Steganography:** Concealing messages within textual data, such as hiding messages within whitespace or using special encoding techniques.

##### **Steganography Techniques:**

- **LSB Substitution:** One of the most common techniques, it involves replacing the least significant bits of the carrier data (e.g., image pixels) with the bits of the secret message. This method is often used in image steganography.
- **Spread Spectrum:** Embedding data by spreading it across the frequency spectrum of the carrier signal (e.g., audio or video), making it difficult to detect without the appropriate decoding algorithm.
- **Whitespace Steganography:** Inserting hidden messages within the whitespace characters or formatting of a text document.
- **Least Significant Digits (LSD):** Similar to LSB substitution, but instead of replacing bits in pixel values, this technique replaces the least significant digits of numerical data (e.g., in audio files).
- **Visual Cryptography:** Encoding a secret image into multiple shares, where each share individually reveals no information about the secret, but when combined, the secret image becomes visible.

##### **Steganography in Practice:**

- **Image Steganography Example:** Embedding a secret message within the pixels of an image using LSB substitution. The modified image appears identical to the original to the human eye, but the hidden message can be extracted using steganography tools.
- **Audio Steganography Example:** Concealing secret data within the frequency spectrum or amplitude variations of an audio signal. The imperceptible changes can be detected using specialized software to extract the hidden information.
- **Text Steganography Example:** Embedding hidden messages within the formatting or whitespace of a text document, making it appear as a regular document to casual observers.


### Hashing

Hashing is a process that converts input data (or 'keys') into a fixed-size string of characters, typically for storage or comparison purposes. Hash functions take input data of arbitrary size and produce a fixed-size hash value, often referred to as a digest or hash code. Hashing is widely used in computer science for various applications such as data retrieval, cryptography, and data integrity verification.

##### **Characteristics of a Good Hash Function:**

- **Deterministic:** Given the same input, a hash function should always produce the same output.
- **Efficient:** The hash function should be computationally efficient, providing fast computation of hash values.
- **Uniform Distribution:** Hash values should be uniformly distributed across the hash space to minimize collisions.
- **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input data should result in a significant change in the output hash value.
- **Non-reversible:** It should be computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original input data from the hash value.

##### **Common Hash Functions

###### There are various hash functions available, each suitable for different purposes. Some common ones include:

- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**
- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**

**Example - Using hashlib for Secure Hashing (SHA-256):**

```python
import hashlib 

data = "Hello, world!" 

hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()) 
hash_value = hash_object.hexdigest() 

print("SHA-256 Hash:", hash_value)
```

##### **Collision Resolution**

In hashing, a collision occurs when two different inputs (keys) produce the same hash value. It's important to note that most hash functions have a fixed output size, meaning that the number of possible hash values is limited. Therefore, collisions are inevitable, especially when hashing arbitrary-length input data.

**Causes of Collisions:**

- **Limited Hash Space:** Hash functions map an infinite set of input values to a finite set of hash values. Consequently, different inputs can produce the same hash value due to the pigeonhole principle, where more items are hashed than there are hash values available.
- **Birthday Paradox:** The probability of a collision increases with the square root of the number of possible hash values. This phenomenon is known as the birthday paradox, where the probability of two people sharing the same birthday in a room is surprisingly high with relatively few people.

**Impact of Collisions:**

- **Data Integrity:** Collisions can lead to data integrity issues, as different inputs producing the same hash value may cause confusion or unintended behavior in applications relying on hash functions for data verification.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** In cryptographic applications, collisions can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as collisions in hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) or digital signatures, potentially allowing attackers to forge messages or bypass security measures.
- **Performance Degradation:** Collisions may impact the performance of hash-based data structures such as hash tables, causing increased lookup times or decreased efficiency due to more frequent collisions and potential collisions.

**Collision Resolution Techniques:**

- **Separate Chaining:** In separate chaining, each bucket of a hash table contains a linked list of key-value pairs with the same hash value. Collisions are resolved by appending the collided key-value pairs to the corresponding linked list.
- **Open Addressing:** In open addressing, collisions are resolved by finding an alternative location (using probing techniques like linear probing or quadratic probing) within the hash table to place the collided key-value pair.
- **Robin Hood Hashing:** A variation of open addressing where collided elements are moved closer to the ideal bucket location, reducing the variance in search times.
- **Cuckoo Hashing:** Another open addressing technique where each key has multiple possible hash locations. Collisions are resolved by displacing other keys already present in the table.

##### **Applications of Hashing:**

- **Data Retrieval:** Hash tables are widely used for fast data retrieval based on keys.
- **Cryptography:** Hash functions play a crucial role in cryptographic applications such as digital signatures, password hashing, and data integrity verification.
- **Data Deduplication:** Hashing is used to identify duplicate data blocks efficiently in storage systems.
- **Consistent Hashing:** Used in distributed systems for load balancing and data partitioning
